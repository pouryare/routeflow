# Future features (parked, not planned)

Ideas that would remove the most manual entry on a phone but are ambitious or risky. Each is **parked on purpose**: when one is picked up, it gets its own spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and its own plan. Until then nothing here is promised.

Every item must end in a **confirmation tap flow** (`docs/tap-flow-principles.md`): the machine proposes, the person confirms with one tap, and the usual 5 s undo applies. Nothing the machine reads is saved without that confirmation.

Origin: the 2026-10-20 mobile-first brainstorm. The pieces that are *not* ambitious live in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-20-mobile-first-interaction-patterns.md`.

## F1. Camera capture (read a document instead of typing it)

**What:** point the phone at a paper and get a pre-filled confirmation sheet.

| Source | Fills | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Cheque | cheque number, bank, amount, due date (Jalali), payer name | `paymentFlow` cheque branch, `/sales/cheques` |
| Supplier invoice / receipt | supplier, date, total, lines if legible | `expenseFlow`, `PurchaseEntry` |
| Delivery note / signed receipt | attaches as a photo to the stop | `DeliveryFlow` done screen |
| Batch label (QR / barcode) | product, batch code, expiry | `receiveFlow`, `stockCountFlow` |

**Why parked:** Persian cheque and invoice OCR accuracy is uncertain, handwriting is worse, and it needs a decision on where recognition runs (on device, or sent to a service, which means customer data leaves the device).

**Open questions to settle in the spec**
1. On-device (Tesseract/ML Kit via WebAssembly, works offline, lower accuracy) or a server/vision-model call (better, needs signal and a privacy decision)?
2. Do we keep the photo? `photos` and `/api/photos` exist, so storage is solved; retention is not.
3. Barcode/QR needs no OCR (`BarcodeDetector` API or a small JS decoder) and could ship **first** as its own small feature: scan a batch label, skip typing the code.
4. Field-by-field confidence: low-confidence fields are highlighted for the person to retype rather than silently accepted.

**Suggested first slice (small, low risk):** QR/barcode scan for batch code in `receiveFlow`. Cheque OCR second. Invoice OCR last.

**Prerequisites:** TapFlow plan Phases 0, 2 and 6 (amount step, payment/cheque flow, receive flow).

## F2. Voice input (speak instead of typing a note)

**What:** a press-and-hold microphone button next to every optional note field (`tf-input` on the `note` steps, complaint description, visit notes, reminder text). Persian speech to text, shown as editable text before saving.

**Why parked:** Persian recognition quality varies by accent, noise and phone; browser `SpeechRecognition` support is uneven (works in Chrome Android, unreliable elsewhere, often cloud-backed); vans are noisy.

**Open questions**
1. Browser API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`, free, cloud-backed, Chrome-only) or a hosted model?
2. Is audio ever stored? Default answer: no, text only.
3. Does it work offline? Probably not; the button hides when offline.
4. Which roles want it? Ask drivers and phone sales before building.

**Suggested first slice:** a `VoiceNoteButton` that only appears where `SpeechRecognition` is available and `navigator.onLine` is true, inserted into the TapFlow `input` step only. Measure how often it is used and corrected before expanding.

**Prerequisites:** TapFlow plan Phase 0.

## F3. Paste-to-parse (turn a pasted message into a draft)

**What:** paste a WhatsApp/Telegram/SMS message and get a draft to confirm.

| Pasted text | Draft |
|---|---|
| "سلام، ۱۰ کارتن شیر و ۵ ماست برای فردا بفرستید" from a customer | order draft for that customer: lines, delivery day |
| A lead's details ("نانوایی X، ۰۹۱۲…، خیابان…") | add-lead draft (`AddLeadFlow` basics + link) |
| A payment confirmation ("واریز ۵ میلیون") | payment draft (`paymentFlow`) |

**Why parked:** needs a parser that copes with informal Persian, Persian/Arabic digits, units ("کارتن", "بسته", "کیلو"), and fuzzy product names. The lead-import decoder (`app/api/geo/decode-link`, `components/leadImport/DecodeConsole`) already shows the pattern for links; free-text is much harder.

**Open questions**
1. Rule-based (regex + product-name fuzzy match against the catalogue; predictable, offline, limited) or an LLM call (flexible, needs signal, needs a data-handling decision)?
2. How is a customer matched when the sender is a phone number: `customers.phone_norm` exact match first.
3. Share-target: register the PWA as a share target so "Share → RouteFlow" works straight from WhatsApp (`share_target` in `app/manifest.ts`).
4. **Ask first:** do phone sales actually receive orders as messages? If not, drop this.

**Suggested first slice:** share-target + order drafts using rule-based matching against `readCatalogue()`, confirmation via `orderQuickFlow`'s final screen.

**Prerequisites:** TapFlow plan Phase 5 (`orderQuickFlow`).

## F4. Force a new password on first sign-in

**What:** an account created from the phone (or the desk) gets a one-time password that is shown once and shared. Nothing makes the person change it, so it stays their password until they do.

**Why parked:** there is no `must_change_password` state anywhere today (users table, sign-in, session); adding it touches login, the session cookie and every route that assumes a signed-in user can proceed.

**First slice:** a boolean on the user set at creation and on admin password reset, a redirect to a «رمز تازه» screen from the shell layout while it is set, cleared when the user saves a new password.

## How to promote an item

1. Write `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<item>-design.md` (answer the open questions, pick the first slice).
2. Write the plan with `writing-plans`.
3. Add the new flow/step to the design rules (`docs/mobile-first-principles.md`, once it exists) so it follows the same anatomy.
