# To-do report

## Done
- [x] Read all pages and routes; documented purpose and page interactions (`AUDIT-2026-10-20.md` Part 1)
- [x] Checked for a code-audit skill: none exists; did not install unreviewed third-party ones
- [x] Static checks: `tsc`, `eslint`, `npm audit`, `vitest`
- [x] Playwright crawl: 55 routes x 7 roles (desktop), 12 routes x 3 roles (mobile)
- [x] Accessibility scan, API permission matrix (221 endpoints x 8 identities), tenant-isolation probes
- [x] Login/logout flows, input-validation probes, click-testing for all roles, form-testing with hostile input
- [x] Driver stop actions and order status flow tested
- [x] 41 findings listed in `AUDIT-2026-10-20.md`
- [x] Always-on rule added to `CLAUDE.md`: this report is rewritten after every prompt

- [x] Step 1: fixed build breakers (holidays page moved header into a layout; driver bundle no longer imports the database); `next build` passes
- [x] Step 2: input validation (order lines/dates/notes/seller, payment amount/date, money cap for all `_toman` fields, cheque/payment/order forms, commission rows stamped with organization, user/group/product/complaint limits) + tests
- [x] Step 3: login `?next=` restricted to same-site paths; rate limit uses the proxy-appended address and per-username buckets; van roles can sign out (`/api/logout`, `/api/me`, `/api/prefs`) — verified in browser + tests
- [x] Step 4: `/report` (districts filter) and runs view (scope spliced into plannable-orders SQL) fixed; platform_owner now treated as owner on pages, nav, sweeps, order transitions; analytics customers keep the organization guard — verified on a production build for 4 roles + tests
- [x] Step 5: confirmation before order cancel/return/credit-reject, facility, photo, holiday and lead-list/pin deletes, and user deactivation (`lib/confirm.ts`); verified in browser (dismiss = no request, accept = request) + guard test
- [x] Step 6: accessibility — contrast tokens (`--muted`, `--text-faint`, amber, status text via `STATUS_TEXT`, `.text-accent`), labelled selects/inputs, marker titles, `inert` closed sheets: axe contrast nodes 496 → 16 across 32 owner pages (reduced motion); markers/labels/aria-hidden-focus issues cleared
- [x] Step 6: dependencies — `npm audit` 15 → 5 (critical and moderate cleared): next 16.4.2, maplibre-gl 6, sharp 0.35, vitest 5, xmldom, js-yaml, undici, source-map-js, brace-expansion; remaining 5 are eslint-config-next transitive (dev tooling only; npm's suggested fix is a downgrade)
- [x] Step 7: remaining audit items — payments/tasks/alerts scoped (group manager = own group, salesperson = own); map data routes readable by the roles the nav sends there; /planner, /facilities (and receipts/complaints for rep manager) gated to match; driver stop resubmission (identical = no-op, different = 409) and cash cap; payment POST refuses another group's customer; module-level shared `NextResponse` fixed (empty 404 bodies); raw state code replaced by label; geolocation no longer requested on /login and /offline; notification popover width — verified on a production build + tests

## Not done / gaps
- [ ] Semgrep never ran (Python dependency conflict)
- [ ] Vector basemaps (maplibre-gl 6) cannot be rendered offline here; module shape verified only. Smoke suite (needs Chromium + server) not runnable in this container
- [ ] 16 contrast nodes remain (faint-on-sunk tint, one hover label, one accent-fill label); two selects and one link-in-text still unlabelled/unstyled for axe
- [ ] Deliberately not done: redirecting a signed-in user away from /login (a valid-signature cookie for a since-deactivated user would loop between proxy and page); soft-404 HTTP 200 on unknown ids (Next streaming behaviour); /leads for rep_manager (nav and proxy admit it, the data routes are manager-only — needs a product decision on what a rep manager may see)
- [ ] Full CRM add-lead flow and tasks-board drag-and-drop not exercised
- [ ] Stock movements, cheque lifecycle, batches, routing commit, notification delivery tested only by page load and API status

## Notes
- Audit item 16 correction: `/api/sync/*` refusing platform_owner is intentional (`hasSyncClient`), not a bug.

## Next steps
1. Decide the `/leads` access for rep_manager (see Not done), then align nav, proxy and data routes
2. Optionally finish the remaining test gaps (CRM add-lead, tasks drag-and-drop, stock/cheque/batch flows)
