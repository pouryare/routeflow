/** What a task's `kind` is called, and which tone its card wears.
 *
 *  One place, because there were two copies (Board, BoardMobile) plus two tone maps
 *  (Board, Pocket), and all four had fallen behind the data: the overdue-customer rule
 *  seeds tasks with kind `call` (lib/db.ts), none of the maps had it, and 33 production
 *  cards printed «call» to a Persian reader with no tone. Two more rule-seeded kinds,
 *  `delivery_retry` and `sample_followup`, were waiting to do the same. `tasks.kind` is
 *  free text in the schema, so this list is the union: tests/no-raw-enum-copy.test.ts
 *  checks every kind the codebase creates is here. */
